## World GDP Data Cleaning and Dashboard Making

GDP stands for "Gross Domestic Product" and represents the total monetary value of all final goods and services produced within a country during a period of time, typically calculated on an annual basis. It is the most frequently used measure of economic activity because of its ability to show how well or badly an economy is doing.

Following the steps shown in an inspiring video I found from a [LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hesty-dewi-maria-siagian-2bb869124_weeklysharingedition-dataviz-datavisualization-activity-6890826740298596352-kDwE), I built a Tableau dashboard using the same data, which is from The [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) website. The data cleaning process, such as dropping unnecessary columns, filling null values with zero, and transforming the data into the desired format, was also applied in Google Colab before visualizing the data in a Tableau worksheet.
